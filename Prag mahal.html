            <h1>Prag Mahal Bhuj</h1>
            <p><b>Prag Mahal is named after Rao Pragmalji II, who commissioned it and construction began in 1865. It was designed by Colonel Henry Saint Wilkins in Italian Gothic style where materials are a fusion of Indian and Italian. The construction of the palace was completed in 1879 at the cost of 3.1 million at 1879 which is today cost 322.5 million. The palace was severely damaged in 2001 earthquake but most of it is repaired now and open for public viewing. There are two rooms along with the hall open for public on the ground floor while there are two more rooms open on a higher floor. Apart from this, the clock tower is also open to visitors. Ticket counter is in the clock tower next to the portico. After the ticket counter take the flight of steps leading to the main Durbar Hall laced with ornate arches. Before entering the Durbar Hall, all visitors must remove their shoe. The Durbar Hall is a European style hall beautifully decorated with chandeliers, mirrors and other antiques. This is the best part of the Prag mahal which I like the most. There are other exhibition halls displaying the belongings of royal family (Hunting trophies, thrones, guns, furniture etc.). It seems most of the artifacts are kept here just to fill up the space. After enjoying the beauty of the artifacts in the palace, head up to the clock tower, which is 150 feet high and offers a panoramic view of the Bhuj city from its fifth floor. Clock tower building is separated from the other part by a small open passage or terrace. Stay at this photo spot for a while before entering the clock tower. For reaching the Clock tower summit you must climb three stories of narrow and winding staircase. At the clock tower platform there is a huge bell which used to chime in olden days. There is also a detailed explanation of how the clock-tower once functioning.
