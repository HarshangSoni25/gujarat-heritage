            <h1>Laxmi Vilas Palace</h1>
            <p><b>The Laxmi Vilas Palace in Vadodara was built in 1890 by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III for a whopping Rs 27,00,000 or 1,80,000 pounds, a huge sum at that time. The Moti Bagh Cricket Ground is situated adjacent to the museum here making it a coveted address, along with the offices of the well-known Baroda Cricket Association. The complex also has the iconic stepwell that dates to 1405 AD and is known as Navlakhi Vav. While it is almost impossible to accurately depict the value of such an imposing and gargantuan landmark of the country, estimates state that property prices in this area may be anywhere between Rs 7,000 and Rs 8,000 per sq ft. Taking that into account, it should be mentioned that the palace complex spans a whopping 700 acres, which works out to be a massive 3,04,92,000 sq ft. Taking Rs 8,000 per sq ft as the prevailing market rate, the final valuation, at an approximation, would be at least Rs 2,43,93,60,00,000. To state this in words, the Laxmi Vilas Palace will be worth a mind-boggling Rs twenty four thousand three hundred and ninety three crores and sixty lakhs. Considering the heritage value and history of the structure, this can easily go up to a huge Rs 25,000 crores even!
                Built as the private residence for Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III in 1890, Laxmi Vilas Palace is one of India’s biggest architectural marvels. It makes use of the Indo-Saracenic architectural style, fusing elements marvelously from Mughal, Hindu and Gothic design styles, along with generously using minarets, domes and arches alike. Built in 1890, the main architect was reportedly Charles Mant while being supported by Robert Fellows Chisholm. 12 years were required for building this imposing structure covering 700 acres and almost four times the size of Buckingham Palace in the UK. It is one of the biggest palaces ever constructed, accommodating numerous buildings including the Makarpura Palace, Moti Baug Palace, Maharaja Fateh Singh Museum and Pratap Vilas Palace among others.
