            <h1>Dutch Garden Surat</h1>
            <p><b>Dutch Garden is located in Nanpura and is one of the most popular tourist sites in Surat. Besides beautyhe garden has been designed in a European style. The well-planned and well-maintained garden gives a wonderful recreational space to the locals as well as tourists.
                In 1612, the Englishmen after establishing a trading factory in Surat were followed by the Dutch and the French. However, in that period,due to the growing significance of the city of Mumbai, Surat consequently lost its prominence due to
                 the climatic conditions and political reasons. After becoming the first municipality of Gujarat in 1852, Surat became the major business city of Gujarat and also popular for the textile industries. During this time, many Englishmen and Dutch
                  came to Surat to give way to their trading business and lead the state towards a flourishing economy. These people established a burial ground in the city to cremate businessmen who came here for trading purposes and this place is now known as the Dutch Garden.
                  Reed died in 1691. The interesting thing is that these impressive burial sites also enhance the beauty and brilliance of the place.The Dutch Garden is also the resting place of certain English and Dutch explorers who landed and settled in Surat. The most remarkable mausoleum is that of Baron Adrian Van Reed. He was the person who is believed to have established the first Dutch port for trading in Surat; Reed died in 1691. The interesting thing is that these impressive burial sites also enhance the beauty and brilliance of the place.
